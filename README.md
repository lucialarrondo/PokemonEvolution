# PokemonEvolution
This code provides a gui interface that allows the user choose a pokemon and see how they evolve.
The main window has 9 buttons, each represents a different pokemon. The user needs to pick one.
When the option has been chosen, another window is open with the image of the pokemon chosen.
Then the user must press any key to see the pokemon evolutions in the secondary window. When the
evolutions are finish both windows are closed.
